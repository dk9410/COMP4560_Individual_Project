# Weekly Note

## Week 1-2
### -- Summary:
_During these 2 weeks we have done 2 major tasks. The first one is completing all the paper work and enrolling into the ISIS._

_The Second thing we accomplished is settling down the final research topic. Since there are tons of interesting HCI topics we can study in musical area, it is not easy to decide which one suits both of us most. After several talks and through consideration we both agree on choosing a bunch of typical Sequencer Application designed especially for iPad, and conducting a user study to evaluate the strength and weakness of those different designs. By doing this, I can have a taste of how academic research works, especially in HCI area. Hopefully, at the end of this report we can make some useful suggestions and design guidances for future work.   _

# Weekly Note

## Week 1-2
### -- Summary:
_During these 2 weeks we have done 2 major tasks. The first one is completing all the paper work and enrolling into the ISIS._

_The Second thing we accomplished is settling down the final research topic. Since there are tons of interesting HCI topics we can study in musical area, it is not easy to decide which one suits both of us most. After several talks and through consideration we both agree on choosing a bunch of typical Sequencer Application designed especially for iPad, and conducting a user study to evaluate the strength and weakness of those different designs. By doing this, I can have a taste of how academic research works, especially in HCI area. Hopefully, at the end of this report we can make some useful suggestions and design guidances for future work.   _
### -- Tasks:
* Exploring 50+ musical Applications on iOS and find out 10+ typical Sequencer App
* Classify those Sequencer into 2-3 categories base on their designs  

## Week 3

### -- Summary:
_Honestly, I have not done too much work this week due to some personal issues, which it is necessary to purpose in the next meeting(how to balance between two different life, or I have to choose one of them)._

_The limited work I have down on week 3 is specifying the criteria to pick different types of sequencer_

#### Criteria:
> ###### Concrete:
>> Grid-based:
>>>1. One Track: _minicomposer_
>>>2. Multi-Tracks: _Auxy & Beatwave_

>> Euclidean-based:
>>>1.   _Necklace & Trigger Box_

> ###### Abstract:
>> pitch on x-axis or y-axis
>>> 1. x-axis:
>>> 2. y-axis:

>> Quantized
>>> 1. _Orbita & Loop_

>> LEGO-based


### -- Tasks:
* Setup a GitHub Repository for version control of the final report
* Build up a Appendix of the Sequencer Application
* Reading _The reacTable: Exploring the Synergy between Live Music
Performance and Tabletop Tangible Interfaces_

## Week 4

### -- Meeting agenda:

1. Questions on The reacTable...
 - _Why Live Music Perform is the playground for the advanced HCI ?_
    - This essay is proposed 10 years ago, has time changed?
      - What about the new tech i.e. VR, Gesture Control...
    - How about the painting process ? similar to music compose, painting is also a process of innovation and creation. If not, is that because painting don't have the high dimensional control, as well as the process of painting is not continuous.
    **_Continuous and multidimensional control, naturally tends to avoid the ubiquitous files, folders and hyperlinks metaphors, still dominant in HCI._**

  - _How important is Evaluation Matrix ?_

    - Also called decision matrix i.e. SWOT
    - How Aussie learn matrix ?
  - _In page 144, under the sub-title Scalability, it discuss a measurement(or criteria) to justify the complexity(or Scalability) of tangible platform.
    - Is there are similar criteria to evaluate the iOS musical application, more specifically, the sequencer.
    - Or this could be the work I should do in my report to propose a criteria or design guidances for future work

  -  _The relation between Synthesizer and Sequencer ?_
    It looks like Sequencer is a larger category in which  synthesizer consist of every single "note" of sequencer.
    - **Synthesizer :** _"A synthesizer app exposes a selection of controls to a syn- thesis engine, and provides a piano-style keyboard for trig- gering the synthesized sounds."_
    - **Sequencer :** _"This category is inclusive of both drum machines and step sequencers. Time is divided into some number of dis- crete steps (16, 32, or 64), and time then moves step-by- step from left to right, according to a set tempo."_

  - The classification above if cited from _A Quantitative Review of Mappings in Musical iOS Applications_.  I won't think this thesis is well structured, how do you think ?
    - base on the number of reference,
    - first two reference is like a web page
    - no appendix for the app they studied
    - but it mention one or two thesis about mapping electric instrument  

2. Logic Structure of _The reacTable..._
  > **abstract**

  > **keyword**

  > **introduction**

  > **Body I : Introduce the importance of live music performance on HCI **
  >  > Introducing general music controller

  >  > Highlight the advantage of tabletop Interfaces

  >  > 2 major design problem : _Multi-thread & share Control_

  >  > Specially mention the benefit of the _Visual feedback_

  >  > Luckily reacTable has successfully solved the above problems     

  > **Body II : Introducing reacTable **

  >  > predecessor of reacTable : FMOL

  >  > concept & description of reacTable

  >  > implementation of reacTable

  >  > reacTable keeps the _visual feedback_ design in mind

  >  > evaluation of reacTable : Scalability

  >  > carefully mention the problem of reacTable

  > **conclusion**

  > **acknowledgement**

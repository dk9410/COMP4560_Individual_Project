The reacTable: Exploring the Synergy between Live Music Performance and Tabletop Tangible Interfaces
---
***
1. _We begin by exposing the main reasons that turn live music performance into an ideal test-bed for advanced HCI,_
2. _Robert Moog estimated that a skilled musician is able to generate about 1,000 bits/sec of meaningful information_
3. _music performance outstandingly combines precision with freedom._
4. _It also combines expression and creativity with entertainment._
5. _It provides an excellent ground for studying and comparing interaction by both dilettantes and experts, both children and adults._
6. _the performer no longer needs to control directly all these aspects of the production of sound, being able instead to direct and supervise the computer processes which control these details._
7. _us allowing musicians to work at different musical levels and forcing them to take higher level and more compositional decisions on-the-fly_
8. _multithreaded and shared control approach_
9. _Visual feedback becomes thus a significant asset for allowing this type of instruments to dynamically ‘communicate’ the states and the behaviors of their musical processes_
10. _researchers have often criticized the application of computer vision techniques in tabletop development, pointing out drawbacks such as slowness and high latency, instability, lack of robustness and occlusion problems_
11. _This often poses problems with respect to the scalability of such systems, in terms of the physical objects that can be realistically manipulated on a table, and the restricted level of complexity_

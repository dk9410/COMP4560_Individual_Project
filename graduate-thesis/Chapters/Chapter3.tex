\chapter{Study 1: Classification of music sequencer}
\label{ch: chapter 3}

A quantitative study was conducted to create an interface taxonomy of current music sequencer apps on the iOS App Store. In total, 55 music sequencer applications on App Store have been examed (see Appendix \ref{app:Appendix A}). Several search criteria are implemented to locate music sequencer on the App Store (see Section\ref{subsec: search criteria}). After analysing those music sequencer apps, we proposed classification criteria based on the design of the user interface (see Section \ref{sec: classify criteria}). The 55 music sequencer applications were classify into 3 major groups according to the classification criteria (see Section\ref{sec: result}).

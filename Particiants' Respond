No.6:(With decent music background and have been performing BeatBox for almost 10 years, have experienced in playing Loop-pad very similar to sequencer)
* showing great response in performing on those apps thanks to his rich experience in BeatBox
* BeatBox is quite similar to the way sequencer working
* It would be great that if the sequencer apps can record his sound
* Volotic is a good practice in creating music and is proving a different interface for similar process, however it requires a lot of pre work on figuring out how it works.
* Beatwave is proving a very good user interface to integrate several piece of sound into one part, the UI is very intuitively.
* SAMMI is a very accurate instrument design especially for musician with more demand on single note rather than the whole picture.
* (Optional)EGDR808 is for professionals only which compound accuracy and enjoyment together.    

No.7:(With limited music background like listening to pop music)
* Volotic is more like a game for children
* Feel it a little bit stressful to improvising
* May recommend some of her friend to take part in the user study

No.8: (With certain music background, playing Ukulele in his spare time and also like singing Peking Opera)
* Important features like: Time sequencing
* Visual effect can definitely assist musician to improvise
* Beatwave is providing a more possibilities as well as keeping the UI very intuitively
* However Volotic is more like a game rather than an instrument. The main focus is on position those symbols rather than focus on music itself.
* SAMMI's UI is too simple and requires very high understanding with music
* Definitely will going to play with Beatwave in his spare time.

No.9: (So far the most successful interview, 14 years music background, 12 years on drums, 6 years professional music training, 3 years electric music making)
* Probably going to use the S.A.M.M.I for live performing since it is very simple and intuitive.
* Recon the Beatwave would be great to edit music and create music before hand
* Music sequencer is definitely an instrument like drum machine
* The visual effect is helping and make musician more commit to music creating
* Volotic is really confusing and hard to control. "I think the sound is already there, I am just changing how it looks like"
* SAMMI is more like the alpha version of music sequencer but it is providing more details control on single note, but Beatwave is providing a large picture rather than focus on single note, which is good feature for electrical music
* Definitely will try on Beatwave and SAMMI later
* Willing to do a follow up study if possible   

### 2017/05/01
No.10: (10+ years music background and teaching students music in collage, playing on guitar most of his time, also playing drums in the music bang, master in garage band, writing some song in his spare time to express himself)
* Volotic is the most difficult app to control
* SAMMI's interface is very precise and give very accurate control on single note, he can use this apps to make "song of joy"     
* Since the participant are keen on wring melody rather than create the rhythm, he prefer SAMMI than the others.
* Will try on Beatwave to create songs later
* As a music teacher he may use iPad to teach younger students, for students over grade 7, he think it is better to give them the real instrument
* Participant do reckon those apps as an instrument.

No.8:(With decent music background and have been performing BeatBox for almost 10 years, have experienced in playing Loop-pad very similar to sequencer)
* showing great response in performing on those apps thanks to his rich experience in BeatBox
* BeatBox is quite similar to the way sequencer working
* It would be great that if the sequencer apps can record his sound
* Volotic is a good practice in creating music and is proving a different interface for similar process, however it requires a lot of pre work on figuring out how it works.
* Beatwave is proving a very good user interface to integrate several piece of sound into one part, the UI is very intuitively.
* SAMMI is a very accurate instrument design especially for musician with more demand on single note rather than the whole picture.
* (Optional)EGDR808 is for professionals only which compound accuracy and enjoyment together.    

No.7:(With limited music background like listening to pop music)
* Volotic is more like a game for children
* Feel it a little bit stressful to improvising
* May recommend some of her friend to take part in the user study

No.8: (With certain music background, playing Ukulele in his spare time and also like singing Peking Opera)
* Important features like: Time sequencing
* Visual effect can definitely assist musician to improvise
* Beatwave is providing a more possibilities as well as keeping the UI very intuitively
* However Volotic is more like a game rather than an instrument. The main focus is on position those symbols rather than focus on music itself.
* SAMMI's UI is too simple and requires very high understanding with music
* Definitely will going to play with Beatwave in his spare time.
